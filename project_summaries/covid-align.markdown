### COVID-Align: Accurate online alignment of hCoV-19 genomes using a profile HMM.

This tool was developed in the lab where I am currently working, to help align the ever growing amount of COVID-19 sequence data against the GISAID COVID sequence database, using a HMM.  
This web platform allows the user to submit up to 1000 unaligned COVID-19 sequences and outputs the alignment as well as a number of summary statistics to evaluate the quality of the submission.
